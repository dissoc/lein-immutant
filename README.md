# lein-immutant [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/immutant/lein-immutant.png)](http://travis-ci.org/immutant/lein-immutant)

A Leiningen plugin for deploying Immutant apps.

## Usage

### Installation

As of version 0.15.0, the plugin only supports leiningen 2.0.0 and up.
To use it, add it to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

    {:user {:plugins [[lein-immutant "1.2.3"]]}}

### Using it

The plugin provides several subtasks for installing, deploying to, and
running an Immutant. All of the subtasks are namespaced under the
`immutant` task. You can use `lein help immutant` to see a full list,
and use `lein help immutant SUBTASK` to get more detailed help for a
specific subtask.

The subtasks provided by the plugin are:

* `lein immutant install [version [install-dir]]` - downloads and
  installs Immutant for you. By default, it will download the *slim*
  distribution of the latest versioned release and put it in
  `<immutant base dir>/releases/`. You can override the version (which
  must be an incremental build number from
  http://immutant.org/builds/, a released version, or LATEST for
  the most recent incremental build) and the install
  directory. Without an `install-dir` argument, the most recently installed
  version will be linked from `<immutant base dir>/current`. If this link
  is present (and points to a valid Immutant install), you won't need
  to set `$IMMUTANT_HOME`.

* `lein immutant overlay [feature-set [version]]` - downloads and
  overlays a feature set onto the currenty installed Immutant. If it
  can't find an Immutant install (either via the `current` link or
  `$IMMUTANT_HOME`), it will download and install the latest versioned
  release first. It will copy the current Immutant install before
  applying the overlay, allowing you to roll back. Currently, the only
  supported feature sets are 'torquebox' and 'hotrod'. The version for
  both defaults to the latest incremental, but can also be any recent
  build number from http://torquebox.org/2x/builds/ and
  https://projectodd.ci.cloudbees.com/job/hotrod-overlay/,
  respectively.

* `lein immutant list [--installs]` - Lists deployments or Immutant
  installs. If called with no options, lists deployed applications. If
  given `--installs` (or `-i`), lists installed versions of immutant
  instead. When listing deploymens, it will only list disk-based ones,
  and won't list anything deployed via the JBoss CLI or management
  interface.

* `lein immutant env [key]` - prints out information about the
  Immutant environment. It currently only displays the path to the
  current Immutant, and the path to JBoss.

* `lein immutant archive [--exclude-dependencies] [--name name]
                         [--context-path path] [--virtual-host host]
                         [--version] [path/to/project]` -
  creates an Immutant archive (suffixed with `.ima`) in target/.
  By default, the archive file will be named after the
  project name in project.clj.  This can be overridden via the
  `--name` (or `-n`) option.   If the --version (or -v) flag is specified,
  the project version will be appended to the name. This archive can
  be deployed in lieu of a descriptor pointing to the app directory.

  Any profiles that are active (via with-profile) will be captured and
  applied when the app is deployed.

  If passed a bare argument, the task will assume it is a path to a
  project to be archived, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  You can override the default context-path (based off of the
  deployment name) and virtual-host with the `--context-path` and
  `--virtual-host` options, respectively. If the
  `--exclude-dependencies` (or `-e`) option is provided, the
  application's dependencies won't be included in the archive.

  If the standard leiningen jar options `:omit-source` or
  `:jar-exclusions` are set, they will be honored for archive
  creation.

* `lein immutant deploy [--archive [--exclude-dependencies] [--version]]
                        [--name name] [--context-path path]
                        [--virtual-host host] [path/to/project]` -
  deploys the current app to the current Immutant. If passed the
  `--archive` option, it will deploy an archive of the app instead of
  a descriptor pointing to the app on disk. This will currently
  recreate the archive on every deploy.  By default, the deployment
  will be named after the project name in project.clj.  This can be
  overridden via the `--name` (or `-n`) option.  If the
  --version (or -v) flag is specified, the project version will be
  appended to the archive name.

  If passed a bare argument, the task will assume it is a path to a
  project to be deployed, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  Any profiles that are active (via with-profile) will be captured in
  the `:lein-profiles` key in the descriptor and applied when the app is
  deployed.

  You can override the default context-path (based off of the
  deployment name) and virtual-host with the `--context-path` and
  `--virtual-host` options, respectively.

  If no Immutant install can be located, the latest stable release
  will be installed.

* `lein immutant undeploy [name or glob or path/to/project]` - undeploys
  an application (or applications) from the current Immutant.
  If passed a bare argument, the task will first treat it as a glob
  argument specifying one or more deployments to undeploy. If it does
  not match any current deployments, it is assumed to be a path to a
  project to be undeployed, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  Examples of matching deployment names with globs:

      Given    Will undeploy
      -----    -------------
      ham      ham.clj, ham.ima
      ham.clj  ham.clj
      ha?      ham.clj, ham.ima, hat.clj, hat.ima
      *h*      ham.clj, ham.ima, ship.clj, ship.ima, moh.clj, moh.ima
      h*.clj   ham.clj, hat.clj
      *        everything

  Note that depending on your shell, you may have to quote or escape *
  and ? in globs.

* `lein immutant run` - Starts up the current Immutant, displaying its console output

  The Immutant to start is specified by the `~/.immutant/current` link
  or `$IMMUTANT_HOME`, with the environment variable taking
  precedence. You can shutdown the Immutant with ^C.

  This task delegates to `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.[sh|bat]`, and
  takes any arguments the standalone script accepts. To see a full
  list, run `lein immutant run --help`.

  It also takes some additional convenience arguments:

   --clustered       Starts the Immutant in clustered mode. Equivalent
                     to passing `--server-config=standalone-ha.xml`
   --node-name=x     (-n=x) To provide unique name when running multiple on
                     same host. Equivalent to `-Djboss.node.name=x`
   --offset=100      (-o=100) To avoid port conflicts when running multiple on
                     same host. Equivalent to `-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100`
   --log-level=DEBUG Sets the default logging level to DEBUG (or any other
                     given valid level). Equivalent to
                     `-Djboss.logging.level=DEBUG`.

  By default, the plugin will locate the current Immutant by looking
  at `~/.immutant/current`. This can be overriden by setting the
  `$IMMUTANT_HOME` environment variable. If no Immutant install can be
  located, the latest stable release will be installed.

* `lein immutant server [port]` - Deploys the current app to the
  current Immutant and runs it. Analogous to `lein ring server`. Takes
  an optional http port parameter.

  By default, the plugin will locate the current Immutant by looking at
  `~/.immutant/current`. This can be overriden by setting the
  `$IMMUTANT_HOME` environment variable. If no Immutant install can be
  located, the latest stable release will be installed.

* `lein immutant test [--log-level] [--offset] [path/to/project]` -
  Runs a project's tests inside the current Immutant. Runs the current
  Immutant with offset ports so it won't interfere with any currently
  running Immutant, deploys the project to it, runs all tests,
  undeploys the app, and then shuts down the Immutant it started. All
  tests specified in the `:test-paths` from project.clj will be
  executed.

  If passed a bare argument, the task will assume it is a path to a
  project to be tested, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  The test Immutant instance is started with offset ports so it won't
  collide with a dev Immutant you may be running on the standard
  ports. By default, the ports are offset by 67, but you can override
  that with the --offset option.

  You can override the default logging level of INFO with the
  --log-level option.

  Note that the log output for the Immutant instance used for the
  test run will be located in
  `<project-root>/target/isolated-immutant/standalone/log/`.

  If your tests are using clojure.test, you can specify an alternate
  output format with --format (or -f), and/or output the results to a
  file with --output-file (or -o). Options for --format are "tap" or
  "junit".

  This is a very simple way to automate your integration testing on a
  [CI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) host.

  If you only want to run a subset of your tests inside or outside of
  the container, you can separate the tests in to different
  directories, and use profiles to activate the correct tests
  in-container. Given the following project.clj snippet:

      :test-paths ["outside-tests"]
      :profiles {:inside {:test-paths ^:replace ["inside-tests"]}}

  `lein test` will only run the outside tests, while
  `lein with-profile inside immutant test` will only run the inside
  tests within Immutant.

  If you want to run all of the tests within Immutant, remove the
  `:replace` metadata to have `inside-tests` added to the existing
  `:test-paths`.

  If no Immutant install can be located, the latest stable release
  will be installed.

By default, the plugin places its files (installed Immutants, the
current link) under `~/.immutant/`. You can override this by setting
`$LEIN_IMMUTANT_BASE_DIR` or by adding `:lein-immutant {:base-dir
"/path"}` to your user profile in `.lein/profiles.clj` or to your
`project.clj`. Setting the base directory in `project.clj` will
override the setting in `.lein/profiles.clj`. Using the environment
variable will override both.

#### Using the plugin on Windows

There are two differences when using the plugin on windows:

* `<immutant base dir>/current` isn't a link to the currently active
  Immutant installation, but is instead a text file containing the
  path to that installation. This is to work around linking issues on
  Windows.

* Using `^C` to exit Immutant after calling `lein immutant run` will
  not work under [git-bash](http://msysgit.github.com/) or
  [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) - it instead just detaches the
  shell from the java process, leaving it running. Using `command.com`
  does not exhibit this problem.

## Development

The plugin has a mediocre midje test suite. You can run it via:

    lein midje
